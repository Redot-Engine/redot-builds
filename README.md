## Godot Builds

This repository contains official builds of the Godot game engine.
You can download these builds from the [Releases](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-builds/releases)
section.

Only pre-releases, dev snapshots, and custom test builds are available
as a part of this repository. For stable releases go to the
[main repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

As an alternative to GitHub we also have a FOSS-friendly mirror at
[TuxFamily](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/).
